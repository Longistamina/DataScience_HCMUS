ARIMA ALGORITHM EXPLAINED (Plain Text Format)
=============================================

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average.

It is a popular statistical method for time series forecasting, especially for non-stationary data.

It has three parameters: ARIMA(p, d, q)
- p: number of autoregressive (AR) terms
- d: number of differencing steps to make the data stationary
- q: number of moving average (MA) terms

The general idea:
- First make the data stationary (with differencing d)
- Then apply AR and MA modeling to capture the structure


2. MODEL COMPONENTS & FORMULAS
------------------------------

A. DIFFERENCING (The "I" in ARIMA)
----------------------------------
Used to make the time series stationary.

First-order difference:
    Y'_t = Y_t - Y_{t-1}

Second-order difference:
    Y''_t = Y'_t - Y'_{t-1}
         = Y_t - 2Y_{t-1} + Y_{t-2}

We usually choose d = 1 or 2.

B. AUTOREGRESSIVE (AR) COMPONENT
--------------------------------
In AR(p), we model the current value as a linear combination of past values.

General AR(p) model:
    Y_t = c + φ₁Y_{t-1} + φ₂Y_{t-2} + ... + φ_pY_{t-p} + ε_t

Where:
- φᵢ are coefficients
- c is a constant
- ε_t is white noise (random error)

C. MOVING AVERAGE (MA) COMPONENT
--------------------------------
In MA(q), we model the current value as a linear combination of past errors.

General MA(q) model:
    Y_t = μ + ε_t + θ₁*ε_{t-1} + θ₂*ε_{t-2} + ... + θ_q*ε_{t-q}

Where:
- θᵢ are coefficients
- μ is the mean of the series
- ε_t is white noise


3. ARIMA(p, d, q) MODEL
-----------------------
Combine all three elements:

If d = 1:
    ΔY_t = Y_t - Y_{t-1}

Then fit ARMA(p, q) model on the differenced data:

    ΔY_t = c + φ₁*ΔY_{t-1} + ... + φ_p*ΔY_{t-p}
               + ε_t + θ₁*ε_{t-1} + ... + θ_q*ε_{t-q}

Or, in full ARIMA notation:
    Y_t = c + φ₁*Y_{t-1} + ... + φ_p*Y_{t-p}
               + ε_t + θ₁*ε_{t-1} + ... + θ_q*ε_{t-q}
    (after applying differencing d times)

     4. MANUAL EXAMPLE (ARIMA(1,1,0))
#####--------------------------------#####
Let's walk through a small manual example.

Assume:
- We have the following time series:
    Y = [10, 12, 13, 16, 18]

- Step 1: Differencing (d = 1)
    Y'_t = Y_t - Y_{t-1}
    Y' = [12-10, 13-12, 16-13, 18-16] = [2, 1, 3, 2]

    Now we work with Y' = [2, 1, 3, 2]

- Step 2: Fit AR(1) model on Y'
    Model: Y'_t = c + φ₁Y'_{t-1} + ε_t

    Let's assume:
    c = 0.5
    φ₁ = 0.6

    Predict the value of Y'_5 (next value in differenced series)
    Use last known Y'_4 = 2

    Y'_5 = 0.5 + 0.6 * 2 = 1.7

- Step 3: Convert back to original scale
    Recall last original value was Y_5 = 18
    So Y_6 = Y_5 + Y'_5 = 18 + 1.7 = 19.7

    Final forecast: Y_6 ≈ 19.7


5. CONCLUSION
-------------
ARIMA is a powerful tool for forecasting univariate time series.
- Use differencing to remove trend (d)
- Use AR (p) for past values
- Use MA (q) for past forecast errors

ARIMA(p, d, q) can be tuned manually or with software tools (e.g., AIC/BIC in Python or R)
