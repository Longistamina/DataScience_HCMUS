Example to Illustrate the Difference Between BernoulliNB and MultinomialNB
Vocabulary: [football, game, movie, actor]
New Document: "football game game"


************ BernoulliNB *****************
Binarize the Document: The document "football game game" is represented as binary features:

# football: 1 (present)
# game:     1 (present)
# movie:    0 (absent)
# actor:    0 (absent)

Binary feature vector: [1, 1, 0, 0].

Compute P(x∣y) = P(football=1 ∣ y) * P(game=1 ∣ y) * P(movie=0 ∣ y) * P(actor=0 ∣ y)


************ MultinomialNB *****************
Use Word Counts: The document "football game game" is represented as word counts:

# football: 1 (occurs once)
# game:     2 (occurs twice)
# movie:    0 (absent)
# actor:    0 (absent)

Word count vector: [1, 2, 0, 0].

Compute P(x∣y) = P(football ∣ y)^1 * P(game ∣ y)^2 * P(movie ∣ y)^0 * P(actor ∣ y)^0
