Each row is one merge step

The first 2 columns are the indices of datapoint (or cluster) to be merged)
    #If the index < n_sample, then this is leaf node (at the endings of dendogram) => individual datapoints
    #If the index > n_sample, then this is a non-leaf node or internal node (inside the dendogram) => clusters of datapoints
    (calculate the result of index - n_sample = the number of datapoints in this cluster)

The 3rd column is the distance between 2 leaf nodes (or 2 non-leaf nodes)

The 4th column is the count of individual datapoints (leaf-nodes) of this merge step

#-------------- Explain ---------------------#

Row 1: [0, 1, 1, 2]
    Clusters 0 (A) and 1 (B) were merged.
    The distance between them was 1.
    The resulting new cluster contains 2 data points.

Row 2: [2, 3, 1, 2]
    Clusters 2 (C) and 3 (D) were merged.
    The distance between them was 1.
    The resulting new cluster contains 2 data points.

Row 3: [4, 5, 3, 3]
    Cluster 4 (E) and cluster 5 (which is the cluster from row 1) were merged.
    The distance between them was 3.
    The resulting new cluster contains 3 data points.

Row 4: [6, 7, 4, 5]
    Cluster 6 (the cluster from row 2) and cluster 7 (the cluster from row 3) were merged.
    The distance between them was 4.
    The resulting new cluster contains 5 data points.

Indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 are the original data points (A, B, C, D, E).

Indices 5, 6, 7 are the newly formed clusters.

The third column (distance) is used to determine where to cut the dendrogram for cluster selection.

The fourth column (number of items in the cluster) is used by dendrogram plotting functions.
