#------------ Apriori Algorithm Explained ----------------#
#---------------------------------------------------------#

The Apriori algorithm is a fundamental algorithm in data mining used for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning. It works on the principle that:

"If an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent."

After deploying the Apriori, we will know which item is usually bought along with which item
=> But them closer in the shelf, so that customers can see them both and make them want to buy them both
=> Enhance sales

Key Definitions and Metrics:
----------------------------

1. **Support**:
   Support(X) = (Number of transactions containing X) / (Total number of transactions)
   The frequency of item X across all transactions

2. **Confidence**:
   Confidence(X => Y) = Support(X ∪ Y) / Support(X)
   The likelihood of buying item Y along with a transaction containing item X (buy X, then buy Y for the same transaction)

3. **Lift**:
   Lift(X => Y) = Confidence(X => Y) / Support(Y)
   Interpretation: Lift > 1 implies positive correlation, < 1 implies negative, = 1 implies independence.

4. **Leverage**:
   Leverage(X => Y) = Support(X ∪ Y) - (Support(X) * Support(Y))
   Interpretation: The difference between actual and expected co-occurrence.

5. **Conviction**:
   Conviction(X => Y) = (1 - Support(Y)) / (1 - Confidence(X => Y))
   Interpretation: Measures the degree of implication; higher values suggest stronger rules.


Lift > 1:
    - A and B appear together more often than expected.
    - Positive correlation.
    - The presence of A increases the likelihood of B.
    - Strong association.

Lift = 1:
    - A and B appear together exactly as expected under independence.
    - No correlation.
    - The presence of A has no effect on the likelihood of B.

Lift < 1:
    - A and B appear together less often than expected.
    - Negative correlation.
    - The presence of A decreases the likelihood of B.
    - Weak or inverse relationship.


Apriori Algorithm Steps
-----------------------

1. Set a minimum support threshold.
2. Find all frequent 1-itemsets that meet the minimum support.
3. Generate candidate 2-itemsets from frequent 1-itemsets.
4. Count the support of candidate 2-itemsets.
5. Prune those with support less than the threshold.
6. Repeat the process to generate 3-itemsets, 4-itemsets, etc., until no more frequent itemsets can be found.
7. Generate association rules from the frequent itemsets using the confidence and lift thresholds.


{Bread, Butter} ⇒ Milk
LHS = Left-Hand Side of the rule = {Bread, Butter}
RHS = Right-Hand Side of the rule = Milk

Transaction Dataset:
--------------------
T1: {Milk, Bread, Butter}
T2: {Milk, Bread}
T3: {Milk, Butter}
T4: {Bread, Butter}
T5: {Milk, Bread, Butter}

Total Transactions (N) = 5

Item Frequencies:
-----------------
Milk:   4/5 = 0.80
Bread:  4/5 = 0.80
Butter: 4/5 = 0.80


========================
2-Itemsets and Rules
========================

## Itemset: {Milk, Bread}
Support: 3/5 = 0.60 (Moderate-High Support)

Rule: Milk => Bread
  Confidence: 3/4 = 0.75 (High)
  Lift: 0.75 / 0.80 = 0.9375 (Below 1: Weak association)
  Leverage: 0.60 - (0.80 * 0.80) = -0.04 (Negative: Appears together less than expected)
  Conviction: (1 - 0.80) / (1 - 0.75) = 0.20 / 0.25 = 0.8  (Low predictive power)
→ Comment: Despite high confidence, Lift and Leverage indicate no real dependency.

Rule: Bread => Milk (same as above


## Itemset: {Milk, Butter}
Support: 3/5 = 0.60 (Moderate-High Support)

Rule: Milk => Butter
  Confidence: 0.75 (High)
  Lift: 0.9375 (Weak association)
  Leverage: -0.04 (Negative)
  Conviction: 0.8 (Low)
 → Comment: Like previous, confidence is high but correlation is not meaningful.

Rule: Butter => Milk
  Same values as above


## Itemset: {Bread, Butter}
Support: 3/5 = 0.60 (Moderate-High Support)

Rule: Bread => Butter
  Confidence: 0.75 (High)
  Lift: 0.9375 (Weak association)
  Leverage: -0.04 (Negative)
  Conviction: 0.8 (Low)
→ Comment: Frequent pair, but Lift and Leverage show weak/no dependency.

Rule: Butter => Bread
  Same values as above


========================
3-Itemset: {Milk, Bread, Butter}
Support: 2/5 = 0.40 (Moderate Support)

Subsets:
--------
{Milk, Bread}: 3/5
{Milk, Butter}: 3/5
{Bread, Butter}: 3/5

Rule: {Milk, Bread} => Butter
  Confidence: 2/3 = 0.6667 (Moderate)
  Lift: 0.6667 / 0.80 = 0.8333 (Low correlation)
  Leverage: 0.40 - 0.48 = -0.08 (More negative)
  Conviction: (1 - 0.80) / (1 - 0.6667) ≈ 0.6 (Very low)
→ Comment: Adding a third item reduces confidence; association is weak.


Rule: {Milk, Butter} => Bread
  Same as above
  → Comment: No improvement in predictability with third item.


Rule: {Bread, Butter} => Milk
  Same as above
  → Comment: Adding Milk does not strongly follow from Bread+Butter.


Rule: Milk => {Bread, Butter}
  Confidence: 2/4 = 0.50 (Low)
  Support({Bread, Butter}) = 3/5
  Lift: 0.50 / 0.60 = 0.8333
  Leverage: 0.40 - 0.48 = -0.08
  Conviction: 0.40 / 0.50 = 0.8
  → Comment: Weak rule with poor predictive power.


Rule: Bread => {Milk, Butter}
  Same as above

Rule: Butter => {Milk, Bread}
  Same as above

========================
Conclusions
========================

- All item pairs have strong individual supports (>= 0.60).
- However, most rule metrics suggest weak or negative correlation (Lift < 1, Leverage < 0).
- Confidence scores are decent (~0.75 for pairs), but Lift and Conviction indicate the items do not improve prediction over chance.
- The 3-itemsets are less confident and even weaker in association.

Apriori can reveal that even frequent co-occurrence does not imply strong association.
