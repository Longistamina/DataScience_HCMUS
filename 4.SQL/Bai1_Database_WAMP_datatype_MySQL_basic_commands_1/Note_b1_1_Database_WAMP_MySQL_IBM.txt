#----------------------- Database ----------------------------------#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------#

Data can be simply considered as information in many forms like text, digit, image,...

Data is very important nowadays, it's the most valuable asset of any company in the world.

Data can be collected anywhere such as fill-in forms, reports, newspaper, surveys,....

Database is the "place" where data is stored in a structured format (usually tabular format).
Steps to create a database:
	+Create database
	+Create tables in database
	+Add in data points in the tables
	+Make queries for specific data points

One database can contain many different tables

One database can be accessed and used by many people 
=> Must have authentication steps to ensure that only admitted people can access to the database (via username, password) 
=> To ensure the security

After authentication is authorization, means provides specific rights for particular people
=> So, some people can only read the database, while others with higher rights can read and modify....

DBMS = DataBase Management System = software that helps create and manage database

#-------------------------------------------------------------------#
#------------------------- SQL - -----------------------------------#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------#

SQL = Structured Query Language

There are 2 types of SQL:
	+DDL: Data Definition Language (to create or setup new database)
	+DML: Data Manipulation Language (to add data, read, modify, or do other tasks in a database)

DDL commands:
	+CREATE: create new database
	+ALTER: change database structure
	+DROP: remove database
	+RENAME: change database's name

DML commands:
	+INSERT: add in new data point(s)
	+UPDATE: update new information for existed data point(s)
	+DELETE: delete data point(s)

#------------------------- WAMPServer -----------------------------------#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------#
WAMPServer is a software that helps work with web programing and web devlopper
(WAMP is for Windows)

WAMPServer integrates many web/server languages like PHP, MySQL, SQLitemanager, PHPMyAdmin...
(like VScode integrates python, C, C++, javascript,....)

For LINUX and MacOS => LAMPServer or MAMPServer (should use MAMPServer)

Or can install MySQL + Workbench only if don't need PHP,...

Remember to install all Visual Studio packages to enable running WAMP/LAMP/MAMP

Choose wanted browser to run LAMP (brave browser), if it asks to use "notepad", choose "No"

Start the WAMP/LAM/MAMP (double click) and let it run all of its services 
(until the symbol turns from Red -> Yellow -> Green)
then choose PhpMyAdmin to run WAMP/LAMP/MAMP on the browser

After that, choose MySQL as "Server choice", 
and login with username = "root", no password

If still cannot activate PhpMyAdmin to access MySQL
=> Right click the WAMP/LAMP/MAMP symbol and check the "port"
=> The Apache's port is usually 80
=> If some other programs also use port 80 (like IIS of windows), can lead to conflict
=> Must change the port

#------------------------- MySQL -----------------------------------#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------#
MySQL (developed by Oracle)

MySQL can be used by accessing MySQL cloud system (server) or installing local MySQL

Can operate MySQL via GUI interface or command line

Can use Python to connect MySQL and make query for data

In MySQL interface on PHPMyAdmin:
	+Click "New" to add new database, type the database name and click "Create"
	+Click the new-created database, type table name in "Name", choose "Number of columns" and click "Go" to next step
	+In the new interface, "Name": is column's name
			       "Type": is datatype of column (INT=integer, VARCHAR=small string, TEXT=large string,..)
			       "Length/Values": the size of the values of that column
	+Click "PreviewSQL" to see the command lines to create that table
	+Click "Save" to save the table, finish creating new table in this database

Delete table:
	+Click the table name
	+Choose "Operations"
	+Scroll down until "Delete data or table"
	+Choose "Delete the table (DROP)"

Import table into database:
	+In MySQL interface, choose wanted database
	+Click "Import"
	+Click "Choose File" and choose target table file (.csv, .xlsx, etc.)
	+Scroll down, tick "The first line of the file contains the table column names (if this is unchecked, the first line will become part of the data)"
	+Click "Import" (at the end of the page)

Export table from database into local file:
	+In MySQL interface, choose database, then choose table
	+Click "Export"
	+If having no special requirements, choose "Quick -...." then scroll down and click "Export"
	+Else, choose "Custom -...."
	+Then, choose format .csv, .sql, ....
	+Scroll down, tick "Put columns names in the first row"
	+Then click "Export"

#--------------- SQL and IBM cloud -------------#
#-----------------------------------------------#
Go to "cloud.ibm.com"

Register an account then login

Choose "Db2" service (lite, free, 200MB storage)

Click "Create" to create a new Db2 Database instance (named Db2-xx where xx is an ordinal number)

Click to select that Db2-xx instance, go to "Manage" then choose "Open Console"

In "Db2 Console" window, choose the Menu symbol (3 gach) "=" to open Menu tab
	+"LOAD" to load or import data like .csv or .xlsx into Db2-xx
	+"EXPLORE" to see which tables does Db2-xx contain
	+"RUN SQL" to run SQL commands


"RUN SQL":
	+From file: to upload an SQL file (*.sql) containing existed query commands and run them
	+Blank: to open an empty script window to type new SQL query commands, then click "Run all"
