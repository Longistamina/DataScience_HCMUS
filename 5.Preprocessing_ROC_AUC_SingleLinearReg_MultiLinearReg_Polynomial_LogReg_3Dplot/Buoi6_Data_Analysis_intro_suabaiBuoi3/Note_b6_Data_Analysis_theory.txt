Data analysis: is to explore the raw data, and extract useful information from it, in order to solve a specific problem

Some analysis techniques:
	+Correlation Analysis: positive, negative or no correlation
	+Regression Analysis: predict, modelization
	+Data Visualization
	+Scenario Analysis
	+Data Mining (Data Exploration)
	+Neural Networks
	+A/B testing: create at least 2 versions of a model/product then examine their effectiveness, and choose the best one as final product

3 rules of Data Analysis:
	1) Identify what we want to know/extract from the raw data
	2) Estimate the raw data's Central Tendency (via mean, median,...)
	3) Identify outliers or abnormal values within the raw data, should retain them or remove them?
	
Some problems may reduce the effectiveness of Data Analysis results:
	+Lack of domain knowledge
	+Use wrong tools (for ex: use z-score although the data is not normally distributed)
	+Let the bias influence the reasoning of result (de dinh kien chi phoi cach suy luan ket qua)
	+Cannot find out the meaning of the statistics (khong tim ra y nghia thong ke)
	+Declare the wrong null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (Ha)
	+Use incorrect / inappropriate graphs or charts, causing misunderstanding
	
Step of Data Analysis:
	1) Business Understanding: understand the problem, the domain we are working on
	2) Data Requirements: identify what types of data to collect, which features does it contain
	3) Data Collection: collect data that meets the requirements
	4) Data Preprocessing: cleaning, handle missing value, transformation, scaling, etc
	5) Data exploration and analysis: univariate analysis, bivariate analysis
	6) Modeling and Algorithm: choose suitable model to train and solve proposed problems
	7) Data Product: what we achieve after model building, training, testing, validating, modifying
	8) Communication: report/present the result for related people in the project
